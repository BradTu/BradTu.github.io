            <p>
                For this update I did a few things. The first thing I did was make it so that the player has their guns in their left hand and
                their swords in their right hand. I did this because with the addition of new weapons it felt more natural to have both types of weapons
                out at once and switch between weapons of the same type. Now with this change left click shoots the guns and the right click attacks with
                the melee weapons. Branching off that point I added a shotgun to the game. It fires a spread of four projectiles at a time and has a longer
                cool down between shots. I added the frost thrower. The frost thrower does little damage but slows down enemies until their frozen. Once their
                frozen there is a damage multiplier when their attacked with melee weapons. I added the lance to the game. It has a high attack rate with low damage.
                It has a unique trait where it is the only weapon that can destroy the shields of shield enemies. The shield enemy has a shield that blocks all weapons
                except the lance. Once the shield is destroyed it behaves in the same way as a regular melee enemy. The last thing I added to the game this week was the
                dive bomber enemy. They run at the player quickly and explode when close. If the player shoots them once the bomber will explode in place.

                This update to the game was all about adding in the first boss fight. The boss' name is the
                Frozen King. The boss fight takes place over two different phases. During the first phase the boss will
                shoot four frost shots (two from the left hand, two from the right) at the player if they are far away. If the player
                is within melee range the boss will try to hit them with the left/ right sword jab combo. Once the player gets the
                Frozen King's health down to fifty percent he will enter phase two. To start phase two he will do the spinning sword
                attack. When the bosses health is at or below forty percent he will do a one time drop of health and stamina items that will restore
                forty percent of each resource to the player. In the second phase the speed of the boss is increased and he will continue to use 
                the frost shot and the left/ right sword jab combo. A new close range attack is introduced in the second phase. The attack consists 
                of a frozen cloud being bursted which if it hits the player will freeze them in place and the Frozen King will follow it up with a 
                devestating double sword hit that does high damage. Finally when the boss' health is less than fifteen percent he will do one final 
                spinning attack in desperation. The behavior tree of the boss is pictured above.

            <p>
                For this update I focused on level generating. All of the rooms are the same size and shape. They differ in the number
                of doors that they have. They can have 1-4 doors on them either going up, right, down, or left. The result is that you
                have levels that can very a decent amount in how they branch out in different directions. After I got the level generator 
                working properly I then made it so that 5 enemies will spawn in a room when the player enters it. The number of melee and
                shooting enemies is random. I also made it so that the player could not leave a room until all of the enemies have been defeated.
                Following that they can return to and from rooms that have been cleared.

            <p>
                The focus of this update was to add juice to the game. I did this by adding camera shake for all damage dealing and receiving. There
                is larger camera shake when the player is dealing damage then receiving it. I also made it so that whenever the player or enemies take
                damage they flash a different color. I also added a trail renderer to the player when they dodge as well as making them turn transparent.
                Now when the player dodges they have invinciblity frames too. I also improved the sword combat so that hits are more accurately detected.

            <p>
                To start the game I first started by adding the controls and player movement. The player could aim, move, dodge, change weapons
                and shoot/ attack with the sword. Next I added the melee enemies. The melee enemies chase the player around and when they get within
                a close range they will attack. I also gave them health and they receive damage from the player's attacks. After that I gave the player
                a health and stamina bar as well as giving the enemies a health bar. I added in the mechanic that enemies that are killed with a sword
                will drop ammo, enemies killed with a gun will drop stamina points and enemies that are killed using both weapons will also drop health points. The final
                thing I added to the game at this point was shooting enemies. They stay stationary and fire bullets at the player.

            <br>
            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                This game is going to be a 2D top-down action adventure game that focuses on combat and resource management. 
                There will be both guns and melee weapons with different abilities and attributes. It will feature procedurally 
                generated levels that culminate in a boss fight. It will be in the realm of a semi-difficult game.
            </p>
            <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
            <p>
                The core mechanics of the game are shooting guns and attacking with melee weapons. The player will toggle through 
                guns using the ‘Q’ button or mouse scroll up and toggle through melee weapons using the ‘E’ button or mouse scroll down. 
                In order to get ammo to reload weapons the player must kill enemies using melee weapons. The player will get stamina to dodge 
                by killing enemies with guns. The player will get health by killing enemies using combo kills where they use both guns and 
                melee weapons in a combo to kill enemies. 
            </p>

                On medium difficulty the player will have a limited number of lives and respawn in the previous room they were in.
                On easy difficulty the player will have unlimited lives and respawn in the previous room they were in.

                At the end of each floor will be a boss fight. After killing the boss the player will get on an elevator to a new floor 
                the game will end at the last boss fight on the third floor.

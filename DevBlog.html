                For this update I made the third and final boss fight of the game. I decided to change things up a little bit for this boss
                fight. This boss fight features two different bosses. The King who wields dual maces and primarily focuses on melee attacks.
                He has one attack where he swings forward his right then left mace. For his other melee attack he swings forward both maces and then
                follows it up by swinging them out and then smashing them together. For his one ranged attack he shoots out a bullet that doesn't
                deal damage but grows vines around the player and holds them in place for a few seconds. The Queen focuses primarily on ranged attacks.
                Instead of chasing the player she moves around the room from point to point. When the player is far away she shoots one bullet from each
                of her guns. When the player is close, she does a smash attack with the spikes on her guns. I decided not to give the bosses multiple
                phases this time because I felt that there was substantial complexity in having to balance avoiding attacks from both of them at once while
                also attacking them with both guns and swords. I also feel that this boss fight is the perfect send off for this game because it is
                a true test of what the game has been teaching the whole time. The vast majority of the game envolves the player fighting both melee
                and ranged enemies at the same time. So this is a good final test that forces the player to take those skills they learned to the next
                level with two aggresive enemies that are stronger and larger than any they have faced up to this point.

                The focus of this update was the second boss fight. As with the previous boss fight this one also takes part over two phases.
                During the first phase if the player is within melee range the boss will go for a clap attack where he takes his two arms from the back
                and whips them forward. If the player is at a distance the boss will shoot out gears in front of him while spinning around. The gears
                that he shoots off will bounce off of the walls three times before being destroyed. Once the player gets the boss's health down to fifty
                percent he will do an explosion attack and enter phase two. During phase two if the player is close he will do either the clap attack
                or the explosion. If the player is far away he will do the spinning shooting sequence again, but this time he will be shooting gears
                both in front of him and behind him. He has another long range attack too. The boss will walk to the center of the room and electric bolts will
                shoot out from each of his arms and he will spin around. There are also two electric fields on the left and right side of the room so the
                player will have to circle around the boss in a safe area. The behavior tree is pictured above.

            <p>
                For this update I did a few things. The first thing I did was make it so that the player has their guns in their left hand and
                their swords in their right hand. I did this because with the addition of new weapons it felt more natural to have both types of weapons
                out at once and switch between weapons of the same type. Now with this change left click shoots the guns and the right click attacks with
                the melee weapons. Branching off that point I added a shotgun to the game. It fires a spread of four projectiles at a time and has a longer
                cool down time between shots. I added the frost thrower. The frost thrower does little damage but slows down enemies until they're frozen. Once they're
                frozen there is a damage multiplier applied when they're attacked with melee weapons. I added the lance to the game. It has a high attack rate with low damage.
                It has a unique trait where it is the only weapon that can destroy the shields of the shield enemies. The shield enemy has a shield that blocks all weapons
                except the lance. Once the shield is destroyed it behaves in the same way as a regular melee enemy. The last thing I added to the game this week was the
                dive bomber enemy. They run at the player quickly and explode when close. If the player shoots them once the bomber will explode in place.

                This update to the game was all about adding in the first boss fight. The boss's name is the
                Frozen King. The boss fight takes place over two different phases. During the first phase the boss will
                shoot four frost shots (two from the left hand, two from the right) at the player if they are far away. If the player
                is within melee range the boss will try to hit them with the left/ right sword jab combo. Once the player gets the
                Frozen King's health down to fifty percent he will enter phase two. To start phase two he will do the spinning sword
                attack. When the boss's health is at or below forty percent he will do a one time drop of health and stamina items that will restore
                forty percent of each resource to the player. In the second phase the speed of the boss is increased and he will continue to use
                the frost shot and the left/ right sword jab combo. A new close range attack is introduced in the second phase. The attack consists
                of a frozen cloud being bursted which if it hits the player will freeze them in place and the Frozen King will follow it up with a
                devestating double sword hit that deals high damage. Finally when the boss's health is less than fifteen percent he will do one final
                spinning attack in desperation. The behavior tree of the boss is pictured above.

                For this update I focused on level generating. All of the rooms are the same size and shape. They differ in the number
                of doors that they have. They can have 1-4 doors on them either going up, right, down, or left. The result is that you
                have levels that can very a decent amount in how they branch out in different directions. After I got the level generator
                working properly I then made it so that 5 enemies will spawn in a room when the player enters it. The number of melee and
                shooting enemies is random. I also made it so that the player could not leave a room until all of the enemies have been defeated.
                Following that they can return to and from rooms that have been cleared.

                The focus of this update was to add juice to the game. I did this by adding camera shake for all damage dealing and receiving. There
                is larger camera shake when the player is dealing damage then receiving it. I also made it so that whenever the player or enemies take
                damage they flash a different color. I also added a trail renderer to the player when they dodge as well as making them turn transparent.
                Now when the player dodges they have invinciblity frames too. I also improved the sword combat so that hits are more accurately detected.

            <br>
            <p>
                To start the game I first started by adding the controls and player movement. The player could aim, move, dodge, change weapons
                and shoot/ attack with the sword. Next I added the melee enemies. The melee enemies chase the player around and when they get within
                a close range they will attack. I also gave them health and they receive damage from the player's attacks. After that I gave the player
                a health and stamina bar as well as giving the enemies a health bar. I added in the mechanic that enemies that are killed with a sword
                will drop ammo, enemies killed with a gun will drop stamina points and enemies that are killed using both weapons will also drop health points. The final
                thing I added to the game at this point was shooting enemies. They stay stationary and fire bullets at the player.

            <header> Updated: June 2, 2020 </header>
            <br>
            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                This game is going to be a 2D top-down action adventure game that focuses on combat and resource management.
                There will be both guns and melee weapons with different abilities and attributes. It will feature procedurally
                generated levels that culminate in a boss fight. It will be in the realm of a semi-difficult game.
            </p>
            <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
            <p>
                The core mechanics of the game are shooting guns and attacking with melee weapons. The player will toggle through
                guns using the ‘Q’ button or mouse scroll up and toggle through melee weapons using the ‘E’ button or mouse scroll down.
                In order to get ammo to reload weapons the player must kill enemies using melee weapons. The player will get stamina to dodge
                by killing enemies with guns. The player will get health by killing enemies using combo kills where they use both guns and
                melee weapons in a combo to kill enemies.
            </p>
            <h2>Controls</h2>

            <h2>Losing</h2>
            <p>
                The player will die if they take too much damage from incoming attacks and their health is at zero.

            <p>
                The game will be made up of three floors. Each floor is made up of ten procedurally generated interconnected rooms.
                At the end of each floor will be a boss fight. After killing the boss the player will get on an elevator to a new floor
                the game will end at the last boss fight on the third floor.

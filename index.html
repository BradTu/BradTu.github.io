      <p>
        Hi and welcome to my game development portfolio, I hope you enjoy your stay!
        My name is Brad Tully I recently graduated from the University of Denver with
        a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science focusing specifically in gameplay programming
        and design. I minored in Mathematics and Emergent Digital Practices. Through my education I learned
        the fundamentals in programming software, computer science, game design, maths and a basic foundation in the arts.
        I am looking to apply my experiences of designing and programming gameplay to make fun and interesting new games within the industry.

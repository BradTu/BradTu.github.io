      <p>
        Hi and welcome to my game development portfolio, I hope you enjoy your stay!
        My name is Brad Tully. I love making games and have been designing and programming games for several years now. You can find the different
        games I have made in the past on my projects page and what I am currently working on at my Dev Blog. My current project is called Gun and Sword!
        I studied Computer Science in college and received my Bachelor of Science degree. I focused my computer science studies on game development because why wouldn't
        you do that if you were given the option!
        <a href="projects.html">Check out some of the projects I have worked on</a> and have a taste of what I have to offer by playing them!
